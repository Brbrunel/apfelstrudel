A hund named Jasper decided to take a tour around Germany.
Jasper got in a BMW and drove to Berlin.
He blasted Rammstein as he sped down the autobahn.
The smell of a meaty Bratwurst salivated Jaspers mouth.
Jasper then decided to mark his territory on a Porsche.  
Jasper was driving down the hauptstrasse and could smell the baeckerei.
He stopped at the baeckerei and bough some gebaech.
